## [Hospital Information System](https://github.com/evlutz/Databases/tree/main/Hospital%20Information%20System%20(MIS))


 * Utilizes a `Normalized Entity Relationship Database (ERDB)` to provide information about Managers, Different Employees, Patients, Visits, Equipment, Rooms, Room Services and Financials

 * The Database includes common `views`, `queries`, and `triggers` to avoid redundancy and ensure the database is concise as well as ensure necessary data is expected such as high risk patients

 * Information from the database can be pulled through an included `Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)` which can be altered to fit the users exact needs

 * The Database was created using Oracle's `SQLDeveloper` and is compatible with other `SQL` clients
