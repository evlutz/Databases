## [Hospital Information System](https://github.com/evlutz/Databases/tree/main/Hospital%20Information%20System%20(MIS))


 * Organizes comprehensive data: Manages information about managers, employees, patients, visits, equipment, rooms, services, and financials using a `normalized ERDB`.
 * Optimized for efficiency and integrity: Employs `views`, `queries`, and `triggers` to streamline data access, prevent redundancy, and highlight critical information (e.g., high-risk patients).
 * Flexible data retrieval: Facilitates information extraction through a customizable `JDBC` interface.
 * Broad compatibility: Developed in `Oracle SQLDeveloper` but accessible using various SQL clients.
